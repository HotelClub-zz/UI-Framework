HotelClub UI Framework

UI Framework is a rapid development front-end framework consisting of core CSS
and JS libraries as well as plugin and vendor extensions. UI Framework eases and
expedites front-end development by providing pre-tested and bullet-proof
solutions to common UI problems such as floated multi-column layouts and browser
inconsistencies.

UI Framework "borrows" heavily from such sources as YUI Library, OOCSS,
Blueprint, the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library and Microformats.
